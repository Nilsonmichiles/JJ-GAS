# GAS
I will put all my GAS (Google Apps Script) code here. This will just be to share, so please feel free to fork it.
Take note that this is not a unified project, but rather just a bank of multiple scripts. They do not have any relation to each other. 

continuecreatingforms.gs (This GAS will continue to create Google forms from a Google Spreadsheet even after the 6 minute limit by saving and then restarting the script.)

dropdownlists.gs (GOOGLE SCRIPT FOR DYNAMIC DEPENDENT DROP DOWN LISTS IN GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS)	

formsfromsheet.gs	(Create one or multiple Google forms from a Google Spreadsheet)

googleclassroomapi.gs (This GAS will create and delete courses, add and delete teachers and students, as well as add and delete assignments, using a Google Spreadsheet as a basis.)
