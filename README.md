# GAS
I will put all my GAS (Google Apps Script) code here in one repository. This will just be to share, so please feel free to fork it. Take note that this is NOT a unified project, but rather just a bank of multiple scripts. They do not have any relation to each other. Most of what will be here may also be shared as separate elements in gists, but not always.

I should also underline that I am just beginning to learn JavaScript, so even though I know the code here works, it may not be in the "correct" format, nor do I understand fully how every line works (but I am stuyding in order to be able to). If you want to "beautify" it, please suggest changes. I will be going through all of them when I learn more to comment on what each part of each script does.
